# Diabetes-prediction
 personal machine learning project benchmarking multiple models for predicting diabetes, with **my model outperforming all others in accuracy**.
### Workflow Steps
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Clean data (handle zeros and outliers).
3. Feature selection and scaling.
4. Train-test split and cross-validation.
5. Train and compare models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, CNN+LSTM, etc.).
6. Hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV.
7. Evaluate using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC.
8. Highlight the top-performing model with the highest accuracy.
9.  Save the model and deploy via Flask or Streamlit.
above all are the steps that involved in predicting whether a person is having diabetes are not
in these case i did prediction with different models like logistc regression ,svm,adaboost,voting classifier when compared to all i got more accuracy at voting classifier
so i  use voting classifieer model to predict the output
